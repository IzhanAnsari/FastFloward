/*Test your Collection
    W1Q4 â€“ Connoisseur
        Write a script that prints the contents of collections for all five Playground accounts (0x01, 0x02, etc.). 
        Please use your framed canvas printer function to log each Picture's canvas in a legible way. 
        Provide a log for accounts that don't yet have a Collection.
